                <h3>Fred Swaniker</h3>
                <p>Fred Swaniker (born 1976) is a Ghanaian serial entrepreneur and leadership development expert. He is
                    passionate about transforming Africa through ethical and entrepreneurial leadership.

                    Swaniker recognized the importance of leadership early on, having served as the headmaster of a
                    secondary school founded by his mother at the young age of 17. This experience likely fueled his
                    desire to address the leadership gap he saw in Africa.</p>
